## Overview

This repository showcases a Laravel 12 application that sends real-time Slack notifications whenever a new user registers. By leveraging queued jobs and Slack webhooks, this demo provides a clear example of how to build an event-driven notification system. 

For the latest version, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/sameer661/laravel-slack-observer-demo/releases).

## Features

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Instantly notify your Slack channel when a new user registers.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilize Laravel's event system to handle user registration events.
- **Queued Jobs**: Improve performance by processing notifications in the background.
- **Slack Webhook Integration**: Easily send messages to your Slack channel using webhooks.
- **Simple Setup**: Quick installation and configuration steps for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel 12**: The latest version of the popular PHP framework.
- **Slack API**: For sending notifications to Slack channels.
- **Composer**: Dependency management tool for PHP.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for storing user data.
- **Redis**: For managing queued jobs and improving performance.

## Installation

To get started with this demo, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sameer661/laravel-slack-observer-demo.git
   cd laravel-slack-observer-demo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment File**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to create your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Generate Application Key**:
   Run the command below to generate a new application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Set Up Database**:
   Update your `.env` file with your database credentials. Make sure to create a database for the application.

6. **Run Migrations**:
   Execute the migrations to set up the necessary tables:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Set Up Queues**:
   Make sure to configure your queue driver in the `.env` file. For example:
   ```
   QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
   ```

8. **Start the Queue Worker**:
   Start the queue worker to process jobs:
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:work
   ```

## Configuration

To configure the Slack webhook, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Slack App**:
   - Go to the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.
   - Choose a workspace to develop your app.

2. **Set Up Incoming Webhooks**:
   - Enable incoming webhooks for your app.
   - Create a new webhook URL and copy it.

3. **Update .env File**:
   Add the following line to your `.env` file:
   ```
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
   ```

## Usage

Once you have set everything up, you can start using the application:

1. **Run the Application**:
   Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. **Register a New User**:
   Navigate to the registration page and fill in the user details. Upon successful registration, a notification will be sent to your specified Slack channel.

3. **Check Slack Channel**:
   Open your Slack channel to see the real-time notification.

## How It Works

### Event-Driven Architecture

When a new user registers, the application triggers an event. Laravel's event system listens for this event and processes it accordingly. This decouples the user registration logic from the notification logic, making the system more modular.

### Queued Jobs

By using queued jobs, the application can handle notifications without delaying the user registration process. The job is pushed onto a queue, and a worker processes it in the background. This ensures that the user receives immediate feedback while the notification is sent asynchronously.

### Slack Webhook

The application uses Slack's webhook feature to send messages to a specified channel. When a new user registers, the application formats a message and sends it to the webhook URL, which posts the message to Slack.
